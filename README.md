# CPP_Minecraft_Clone
Creating a C++ Minecraft Clone using OPENGL, hoping to develop procedurally generated landscape with camera motion, collision detection, lighting with ray-tracing. Additionally I would like to have inventory management and collection, a cool viewmodel, and all the features that make minecraft the amazing game that it is!
